Opentrons pipettes are configurable devices used to move liquids throughout the working area during the execution of protocols. Flex and OT-2 each have their own pipettes, which are available for use in the Python API.

Pages in this section of the documentation cover:

    - :ref:`Loading pipettes <loading-pipettes>` into your protocol.
    - :ref:`Characteristics of pipettes <pipette-characteristics>`, such as how fast they can move liquid and how they move around the deck.
    - :ref:`Configuring Flex pipettes <configuring-pipette-modes>` in different modes, such as for low-volume transfers or only using some of their nozzles.

For information about liquid handling, see :ref:`v2-atomic-commands` and :ref:`v2-complex-commands`.
