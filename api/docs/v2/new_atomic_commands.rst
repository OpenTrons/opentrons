Building block commands execute some of the most basic actions that your robot can complete. But basic doesnâ€™t mean these commands lack capabilities. They perform important tasks in your protocols. They're also foundational to the :ref:`complex commands <v2-complex-commands>` that help you write and run longer, more intricate procedures.

Pages in this section of the documentation cover:

- :ref:`pipette-tips`
- :ref:`liquid-control`
- :ref:`new-utility-commands`
