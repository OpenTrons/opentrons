Welcome To Opentrons Docs!

For the OT 1 API, `please go to this link`__

The Opentrons API is a simple Python framework designed to make writing automated biology lab protocols easy.

We’ve designed it in a way we hope is accessible to anyone with basic Python and wetlab skills. As a bench scientist, you should be able to code your automated protocols in a way that reads like a lab notebook.

**********************

Our Mission
-----------

Opentrons makes robots for biologists.

Our mission is to provide the scientific community with a common platform to easily share protocols and reproduce each other's work. Our robots automate experiments that would otherwise be done by hand, allowing our users

to spend more time pursuing answers to the 21st century’s most important questions, and less time pipetting.

Getting Started
---------------

Our API requires Python version 3.6.0 or later. Once this is set up on your computer, you can simply use `pip` to install the Opentrons package.

.. code-block:: python

    pip install opentrons
