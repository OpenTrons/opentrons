Opentrons API
===============

The Opentrons API is a simple framework designed to make writing automated biology lab protocols easy.

Weâ€™ve designed it in a way we hope is accessible to anyone with basic computer and wetlab skills. As a bench scientist, you should be able to code your automated protocols in a way that reads like a lab notebook.

Work Flow
---------

Writing protocols in Python requires some up-front design before seeing your liquid handling automation in action. At a high-level, writing protocols with the Opentrons API looks like:

1) Write a Python protocol
2) Test your code for errors
3) Repeat 1 & 2 until ready to run
4) Load protocol into calibration UI
5) Save positions of everything on your robot
6) Run the protocol and monitor progress

    from opentrons import containers, instruments, robot

    robot.reset()

    tiprack = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'A1')
    plate = containers.load('96-flat', 'B1')

    pipette = instruments.Pipette(axis='b', max_volume=200)
