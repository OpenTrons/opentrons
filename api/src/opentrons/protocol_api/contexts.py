                         The `'arc'` strategy (default) will pick the head up
                         on Z axis, then move over to the XY destination, then

                         `'direct'` strategy will simply move in a straight
                         line from the current position to the destination,
                         and is suitable for smaller motions, for instance
                         plate streaking or custom touch tip implementations.
