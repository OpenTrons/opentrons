"""Protocol engine command models.

The `protocol_engine.commands` module contains the data models of all
command requests and results the engine is able to handle. It also contains
models and type definitions for command resources, where a command:

- May be pending, running, completed, or failed
- Contains request and, if applicable, result data
- Has timestamps for when it was created, started, completed, and/or failed

Request and result models in the module are defined using Pydantic, because
they are part of the public input / output of the engine, and need validation
and/or schema generation.
