Protocol engine commands.

The `protocol_engine.commands` module contains the data models of all commands
that the engine is able to handle. A command consists of:

- A unique identifier for a single instance of a command request
- An identifying type
- A payload

A command is executed by the `protocol_engine`. Command execution has the
following lifecycle:

0. Command created and assigned an identifier
1. Command state added to protocol state
2. Command side-effects executed based on type and payload; e.g.
    - Calls made to the `hardware_control` module
    - Data read from the filesystem
3. Relavent data is from side-effects is loaded into a command result
4. Command result is added to protocol state
