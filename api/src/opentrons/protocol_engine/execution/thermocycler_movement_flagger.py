        currently open according the engine's thermocycler state as well as
        the hardware API (for non-virtual modules), raises ThermocyclerNotOpenError.

        Otherwise, no-ops.

        Warning:
            Various limitations with our hardware API and Thermocycler firmware mean
            this method can't detect every case where the Thermocycler lid is non-open.

            1. While the lid is in transit, the Thermocycler doesn't respond to status
               polls.
            2. The Thermocycler doesn't report when the user presses its physical
               lid open button; we have to wait for the next poll to find out, which
               can be tens of seconds because of (1).
            3. Nothing protects the Thermocycler hardware controller from being accessed
               concurrently by multiple tasks.
               And updating the Thermocycler state from one task doesn't guarantee that
               that update will be immediately visible from a different task.
               So, for example, if a legacy module control HTTP endpoint starts closing
               the Thermocycler, and then a Protocol Engine task quickly polls the
               Thermocycler through this method, this method may see the lid as open
               even though it's in transit.
