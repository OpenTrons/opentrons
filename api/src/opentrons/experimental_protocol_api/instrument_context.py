    This can be used to call methods related to pipettes - moves or

            The ejector shroud that pops the tip off the end of the pipette is
            driven by the plunger's stepper motor. Sometimes, the strain of
            ejecting the tip can make that motor *skip* and fall out of sync
            with where the robot thinks it is.

            Homing the plunger fixes this, so, to be safe, we normally do it
            after every tip drop.

            If you set ``home_after=False`` to disable homing the plunger, and
            the motor happens to skip, you might see problems like these until
            the next time the plunger is homed:

            * The run might halt with a "hard limit" error message.
            * The pipette might aspirate or dispense the wrong volumes.
            * The pipette might not fully drop subsequent tips.

            GEN1 pipettes are especially vulnerable to this skipping, so you
            should never set ``home_after=False`` with a GEN1 pipette.

            Even on GEN2 pipettes, the motor can still skip. So, always
            extensively test ``home_after=False`` with your particular pipette
            and your particular tips before relying on it.

        :Keyword Arguments:

            * *new_tip* (``string``) --

                - 'never': no tips will be picked up or dropped during transfer
                - 'once': (default) a single tip will be used for all commands.
                - 'always': use a new tip for each transfer.

            * *trash* (``boolean``) --
              If `True` (default behavior), tips will be
              dropped in the trash container attached this `Pipette`.
              If `False` tips will be returned to tiprack.

            * *touch_tip* (``boolean``) --
              If `True`, a :py:meth:`touch_tip` will occur following each
              :py:meth:`aspirate` and :py:meth:`dispense`. If set to `False`
              (default behavior), no :py:meth:`touch_tip` will occur.

            * *blow_out* (``boolean``) --
              If `True`, a :py:meth:`blow_out` will occur following each
              :py:meth:`dispense`, but only if the pipette has no liquid left
              in it. If set to `False` (default), no :py:meth:`blow_out` will
              occur.

            * *blowout_location* (``string``) --
                - 'source well': blowout excess liquid into source well
                - 'destintation well': blowout excess liquid into destination
                   well
                - 'trash': blowout excess liquid into the trash
                If no `blowout_location` specified, no `disposal_volume`
                specified, and the pipette contains liquid,
                a :py:meth:`blow_out` will occur into the source well

                If no `blowout_location` specified and either
                `disposal_volume` is specified or the pipette is empty,
                a :py:meth:`blow_out` will occur into the trash

                If `blow_out` is set to `False`, this parameter will be ignored

            * *mix_before* (``tuple``) --
              The tuple, if specified, gives the amount of volume to
              :py:meth:`mix` preceding each :py:meth:`aspirate` during the
              transfer. The tuple is interpreted as (repetitions, volume).

            * *mix_after* (``tuple``) --
              The tuple, if specified, gives the amount of volume to
              :py:meth:`mix` after each :py:meth:`dispense` during the
              transfer. The tuple is interpreted as (repetitions, volume).

            * *disposal_volume* (``float``) --
              (:py:meth:`distribute` only) Volume of liquid to be disposed off
              after distributing. When dispensing multiple times from the same
              tip, it is recommended to aspirate an extra amount of liquid to
              be disposed off after distributing.

            * *carryover* (``boolean``) --
              If `True` (default), any `volume` that exceeds the maximum volume
              of this Pipette will be split into multiple smaller volumes.

            * *gradient* (``lambda``) --
              Function for calculating the curve used for gradient volumes.
              When `volume` is a tuple of length 2, its values are used to
              create a list of gradient volumes. The default curve for this
              gradient is linear (lambda x: x), however a method can be passed
              with the `gradient` keyword argument to create a custom curve.
