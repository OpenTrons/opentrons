For more details about this release, please see the full [technical change
log][changelog]

  
## New Features
- Guide the user through leveling GEN2 Multichannel pipettes
  
## Known Issues

- The app's run log sometimes displays the wrong current run step ([#2047][2047])
- The app should prevent you from starting a pipette swap while a protocol is executing, but it does not ([#2020][2020])
- When disconnecting and reconnecting to a running OT-2 that doesn't know what time it is, the app's displayed run time will be subtly wrong ([#3872][3872])
