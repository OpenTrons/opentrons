## Changes

- When downloading logs, you will no longer get a pop up to select the filenames to save; instead, the logs will automatically download to your Downloads folder. 


## Bug Fixes

- The Opentrons App will now disable the Run Start Button if your protocol is missing required modules.

## Known Issues

- The app's run log sometimes displays the wrong current run step ([#2047][2047])
- The app should prevent you from starting a pipette swap while a protocol is executing, but it does not ([#2020][2020])
- The app should warn you if you try to simulate a protocol without any valid steps, but it does not ([#3121][3121])
- When disconnecting and reconnecting to a running OT-2 that doesn't know what time it is, the app's displayed run time will be subtly wrong ([#3872][3872])
