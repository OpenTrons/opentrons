## Opentrons App

### New features

- Added support for upcoming pipette hardware revisions

### Known issues

- The app's run log is still having problems displaying the current run step, especially if pauses and resumes are involved ([#2047][2047])
- The app should prevent you from starting a pipette swap while a protocol is
executing, but it does not ([#2020][2020])
- If a protocol run encounters an error, the app will suppress the error message instead of displaying it ([#1828][1828])

## OT2 and Protocol API

### New Features
- The robot now supports a move-to-slot JSON protocol command
- The simulator now prints the run log when a protocol is being simulated
- Added support for upcoming pipette hardware revisions

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where the pipette mount offset and other factory calibration data was not loaded, causing tip probe failures. If this update does not resolve the problem, downgrade to 3.6.5 and then upgrade back to this version.


### Known issues
- While the underlying definition is correct, there is a known API bug that is causing the robot to think a "50ml" tube in a "15/50ml" tuberack is the same height as the "15ml" tube
- Extremely long aspirations and dispenses can incorrectly trigger a serial timeout issue. If you see such an issue, make sure your protocolâ€™s combination of aspirate/dispense speeds and aspirate/dispense volumes does not include a command that will take more than 30 seconds.
