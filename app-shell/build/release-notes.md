<!-- start:@opentrons/app -->
## Opentrons App

### New features

- You can now manually add robots by IP address from the settings page
- Pause and delay command reasons, if any, will now appear in the run log
- Added support for more upcoming pipette hardware revisions

### Bug fixes

- Render the correct image for vial and tube racks for certain labwares

### Known issues

- The app's run log is still having problems displaying the current run step, especially if pauses and resumes are involved ([#2047][2047])
- The app should prevent you from starting a pipette swap while a protocol is
executing, but it does not ([#2020][2020])
- If a protocol run encounters an error, the app will suppress the error message instead of displaying it ([#1828][1828])

## OT2 and Protocol API

### New Features

- Validate json protocols before executing them based on our json schema
- Define and execute V3 json protocols
- Added support for more upcoming pipette hardware revisions


### Known issues
- While the underlying definition is correct, there is a known API bug that is causing the robot to think a "50ml" tube in a "15/50ml" tuberack is the same height as the "15ml" tube
- Extremely long aspirations and dispenses can incorrectly trigger a serial timeout issue. If you see such an issue, make sure your protocolâ€™s combination of aspirate/dispense speeds and aspirate/dispense volumes does not include a command that will take more than 30 seconds.
