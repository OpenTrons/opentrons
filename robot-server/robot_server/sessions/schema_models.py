"""HTTP request and response models.

These models exist to ensure the /sessions API is mapped to a reasonable
OpenAPI Spec. Given the large number of classes and unions involved,
the request and response models need to be ordered carefully.

Mostly, this involves making sure we have responses that are `Union`s
of `ResponseModel`s rather than `ResponseModel`s of `Union`s.
