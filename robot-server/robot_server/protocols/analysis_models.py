    This analyis provides three pieces of information:

    - A smoke test on whether the run is expected to succeed, given available data.
    - The equipment (labware, pipettes, modules) that the protocol will use.
    - The run commands that the protocol is expected to issue.

    !!! important "Important note about non-deterministic protocols"
        Python protocols are allowed to be written in a way that makes their
        behavior non-deterministic. For example, a protocol could use ``random``
        to determine how much volume to aspirate.

        If a protocol is non-deterministic, an analysis may differ from the
        actual run (or any subsequent analysis). If you are writing or using
        non-deterministic protocols, please keep this fact in mind.

        JSON protocols are currently deterministic by design.
