  "labware_help_explanation": "<block>You can make optional positioning adjustments before a protocol run using labware offsets. These adjustments are measured to the nearest 1/10th mm and can be made in X, Y and/or Z.</block> <block>A labware offset is unique to a specific labware in a specific deck slot (and, if applicable, on a specific module) on an OT-2. Once you create an adjustment, it will be stored and can be used if you run the same protocol again. <a_best_practices>Learn More about labware and protocol best practices</a_best_practices></block> <block> Labware offsets apply to the overall labware, not individual features of it. If you need to make adjustments to individual features of the labware, edit your labware definition via <a_labware_creator> Opentrons Labware Creator </a_labware_creator> </block>",

During labware position check, she adjust the pipette position while checking the A1 of the labware to 0.2mm in X, and 1.2mm in Z. Later, Bob is preparing to run the same protocol on that robot. The labware offset that Alice created in Slot 6 will be applied for Bob’s protocol unless he changes or clears it.</block>",
  "multiple_modules_explanation": "<block>To use multiples of a module in one protocol, you need to plug in the module that’s in the lowest numbered deck slot in the lowest numbered USB port on the OT-2.</block> <block>Currently, you can use multiple Magnetic Modules or multiple Temperature Modules. You won’t be able to load multiple Thermocycler Modules. <a_how_to_multiple_modules>Learn more about how to use multiples of a module </a_how_to_best_practices> </block>",
  "multiple_modules_example": "Your protocol has 2 Temperature Modules. The Temperature Module attached to the first port starting from the left will be related to the first Temperature Module in your protocol while the second Temperature Module loaded would be related to the Temperature Module connected to the next port to the right.
