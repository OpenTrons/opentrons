# Python Step Generation

We want to add Python generation to `step-generation` without severely changing the architecture and rewriting all the code.

## Where does the Python go?

The command creators produce a `CommandCreatorResult`. We'll augment that to include Python commands:

```typescript
export type CommandCreatorResult =
  | CommandsAndWarnings
  | CommandCreatorErrorResponse

export interface CommandsAndWarnings {
  commands: CreateCommand[]
  warnings?: CommandCreatorWarning[]
  python?: string // <<<ADD
}
```

Here and elsewhere, we make `python` an optional field so that we don't have to rewrite all the existing code to specify it when creating objects.

The new `python` field contains one or more lines of Python commands. It behaves analogously to the JSON `commands`. When reducing `CurriedCommandCreator`s together, we concatenate their JSON `commands`, so now we will also concatenate their `python` commands too:

```typescript
export const reduceCommandCreators = (...): CommandCreatorResult => {
  const result = commandCreators.reduce(
    (prev: CCReducerAcc, reducerFn: CurriedCommandCreator): CCReducerAcc => {
      const allCommands = [...prev.commands, ...next.commands]
      const allPython = [prev.python, next.python].join('\n')  // <<<NEW
      return {
        commands: allCommands,
        python: allPython,  // <<<NEW
      }
    },
    ...
  )
}
```

## Data flow

The JSON commands in the `CommandCreatorResult`s get propagated to the Timeline, which is where we ultimately get the commands from to write out to the exported JSON file. By analogy, we'll add the Python commands to the Timeline as well:

```typescript
export interface Timeline {
  timeline: CommandsAndRobotState[]
  errors?: CommandCreatorError[] | null
}

export interface CommandsAndRobotState {
  commands: CreateCommand[]
  robotState: RobotState
  warnings?: CommandCreatorWarning[]
  python?: string // <<<ADD
}
```

## Generating JSON and Python in parallel

In the easy case, one JSON command corresponds to one Python command, and we can just emit them side-by-side, like:

```typescript
export const aspirate: CommandCreator<...> = (args, invariantContext, prevRobotState) => {
  return {
    commands: [ { commandType: 'aspirate', params: {...} } ],
    python: `some_pipette.aspirate(...)`,
  }
}
```

Sometimes, we want to emit a Python command that doesn't correspond to any single JSON command. For example, the command sequence for a Mix step has something like:

```typescript
[
    curryCommandCreator(aspirate, {...}),
    curryCommandCreator(dispense, {...}),
]
```

The Python API has a `mix()` that implements both aspirate and dispense. We can generate it by adding a `CommandCreator` that emits the Python `mix()` command with no JSON command:

```typescript
[
    curryCommandCreator(pythonOnlyMix, {...}),
    curryCommandCreator(aspirate, {...}),
    curryCommandCreator(dispense, {...}),
]

const pythonOnlyMix: CommandCreator<...> = (...) => {
    return {
        commands: [],  // emits no JSON
        python: `some_pipette.mix(...)`,
    }
}
```

When the reducer runs, it strings together all the non-empty JSON `commands` to get the final JSON output, and it'll string together all the non-empty `python` commands to get the final Python output.

We need one more tool to make this work: because the Python `mix()` command replaces both the aspirate and dispense, we need to _suppress_ Python generation from aspirate and dispense. We'll do that by adding a new flag to `curryCommandCreator`, so the final sequence becomes:

```typescript
[
    curryCommandCreator(pythonOnlyMix, {...}),
    curryCommandCreator(aspirate, {...}, suppressPython=true),
    curryCommandCreator(dispense, {...}, suppressPython=true),
]
```

Now this sequence works for generating both JSON and Python.
