Docker Guide  
=======================  
Included in this repo are the tools to run a containerized Opentrons robot stack in docker.

This includes the `robot-server` connected to the hardware emulation application. The emulation application includes the Smoothie and magnetic, temperature, and thermocycler modules.

## Requirements

- A clone of [this](https://github.com/Opentrons/opentrons) repo.
- An installation [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- An installation of [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## How to use

Start a terminal and change directory to the root of this repo.

1. Build
   Enter `docker-compose build --force-rm` at the terminal.

2. Run
   Enter `docker-compose up` at the terminal. _The build and run stages can be combined `docker-compose up --build`._

3. Start the Opentrons application. The docker container will appear as `dev`. Connect and run just as you would on a robot.

## Configuration

### Pipettes

By default a `p20_multi_v2.0` is on the left mount and `p20_single_v2.0` is on the right. These can be changed by modifying environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Under the `emulator` section add an `environment` section with a variable called `OT_EMULATOR_smoothie`. A stringified JSON object with `model` and `id` field for the `left` and `right` mounts is defined by `OT_EMULATOR_smoothie`. All fields are optional.

For example to use a `p300_multi` on the right add:

```
  environment:
    OT_EMULATOR_smoothie: '{"right": {"model": "p300_multi"}}'
```

## Known Issues

- Pipettes cannot be changed at run time.
