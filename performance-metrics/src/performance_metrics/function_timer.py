"""This module offers a mechanism for measuring and storing the execution durations of both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

The FunctionTimer class is intended to be used as a decorator to wrap functions and measure their execution times. It utilizes `perf_counter_ns` for high-resolution performance counter measurements and `clock_gettime_ns(CLOCK_REALTIME)` for real-time clock measurements. The use of `perf_counter_ns` ensures the highest possible resolution timer, which is essential for accurate duration measurement, especially for short-running functions. `clock_gettime_ns(CLOCK_REALTIME)` is used to capture the actual start time in real-world time, which is useful for correlating events or logs with other time-based data.
