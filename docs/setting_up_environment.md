## Installing Jupyter, Python Module, quick walk-through

Jupyter is an interactive programming environment that runs in the browser. Jupyter can support multiple programming languages but we will only be using it for Python 3.

To run the OpenTrons SDK you will need to ensure you have Python 3 installed. We recommend you install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) before going any further, this will install Python 3 for you. When installing Anaconda we recommend you use the `Graphical Installer` for `Python3.5`.

After Anaconda and Python 3 are installed, you can get started installing Jupyter by following the official [Jupyter Installation Guide](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

If you have finished setting up Python 3 and you have finished going through the Jupyter installation guide it is now time to run Jupyter.


## Launch Jupyter Notebook App:

1. Click on spotlight, type `terminal` to open a terminal window.
2. Create and Enter the startup folder by typing `mkdir some_folder_name && cd some_folder_name`.
3. Type jupyter notebook to launch the Jupyter Notebook App (it will appear in a new browser window or tab).

If you made it this far without any errors then you are done! You should treat yourself well tonight and celebrate your successes generously!
