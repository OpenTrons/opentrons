## Installing Jupyter, Python Module, quick walk-through

Jupyter is an interactive programming environment that runs in the browser. Jupyter can support multiple programming languages but we will only be using it for Python 3.

To get started installing Jupyter follow the official [Jupyter Installation Guide](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) --- but before you jump into that guide, read this next paragraph.

To run Jupyter with the OpenTrons SDK you will need to ensure you have Python 3 installed. If you're unsure if you have Python 3 installed then you probably don't'. The Jupyter guide links you to a python distrubtion known as [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and recommends you install it to set up python 3. We recommend you install Anaconda before going any further with the Jupyter installation. When installing Anaconda we recommend you use the `Graphical Installer` for `Python3.5`.

If you have finished setting up Python 3 (if your computer didn't have it) and you have finished going through the Jupyter installation guide it is now time to run Jupyter.


## Launch Jupyter Notebook App:

1. Click on spotlight, type terminal to open a terminal window.
2. Create and Enter the startup folder by typing `mkdir some_folder_name && cd some_folder_name`.
3. Type jupyter notebook to launch the Jupyter Notebook App (it will appear in a new browser window or tab).

If you made it this far without any errors then you are done! You should treat yourself well tonight and celebrate your successes generously!
