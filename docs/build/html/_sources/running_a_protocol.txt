Saving Your Protocol
================================

Now that you have your protocol, it's time to convert it to run on the robot.


Saving the File
-------------------------------
Our app supports python (.py) files and JSON files.  

.py File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can download any jupyter notebook files as a .py file, and the app will ignore everything except the containers and commands.  


JSON File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Old JSON files can still be run in 2.0, and still need their deck, head, ingredients and instruction section.  However, we recommend writing all protocols using our new API as they will enable you to do a lot more with the robot - don't hesitate to reach out if you have trouble translating your files!
